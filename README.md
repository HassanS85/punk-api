Overview
Your task is to build a website using React based on the specifications outline below. This will be based on the Punk API which contains all
the data you will need for the task (there is also a link to a data file which we recommend you use before diving straight into using the
API). Please refer to Earworm as well as the sandbox apps we built together during the module!
You will have to use all of the skillsyou have gained over the course of the module to complete this challenge. Take things slowly and
follow Reacts recommendation for building an application as outlined at this link.




What i have completed: the initial task to use usestate and fetch to get data from an API - Punk API and get it to display with the most important info on the site. Have added in search functionality as well as styling.

What went right: the API and React setup were the most difficult parts of this project and i was able to do these parts successfully.

What part i am most happy with: my useEffect function which i sat through with a few people who had explained parts of this to me so i could further understand it. 

What are next steps: to finish off the styling and the filter, which, while present, is currently not functioning.
